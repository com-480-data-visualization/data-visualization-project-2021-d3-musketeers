# Milestone 2

*How did Netflix's release strategy evolve during the last decade?*

1. Introduction:
  - Release trends (i.e. per person, year or month)
  - Counter with number of TV shows and movies, per day or week

2. Geographical and cultural expansion of Netflix, and how its library was updated:
  - *Racing bars* with evolution of content's language per year
  - Map of the world (either static or per year) with a side bar (i.e. showing statistics per country)
  - Graph where movies are nodes and there is a link between two movies if they share a common actor. Then perform community detection to find language communities.

3. Evolution of the content to adapt to the growing demand. 
  - Topic extraction from the content description, per season. Try to find particularities (keywords relevant per season, i.e. Christmas, valentines)
  - Age rating (vertical symmetric barplot, TV shows vs. Movies)
  - Genres (timeline)
